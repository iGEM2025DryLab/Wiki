# Project Overview

## The Problem

Lychees are one of the most beloved tropical fruits worldwide, but they face a critical challenge: rapid deterioration after harvest. Fresh lychees typically lose their quality within 2-3 days, severely limiting their distribution and contributing to significant food waste.

## Our Solution

The Lychee Guardians team is developing innovative synthetic biology approaches to extend lychee freshness naturally and safely. Our multidisciplinary approach combines wet lab experimentation with computational modeling to create sustainable preservation solutions.

## Key Objectives

1. **Understand the mechanisms** of lychee deterioration at the molecular level
2. **Engineer biological systems** to produce natural preservatives
3. **Optimize treatment conditions** through computational modeling
4. **Develop practical applications** for real-world implementation

## Expected Impact

- Reduce food waste in the lychee supply chain
- Extend the geographic reach of fresh lychee distribution
- Create sustainable, bio-based preservation technologies
- Demonstrate the power of synthetic biology in food security
